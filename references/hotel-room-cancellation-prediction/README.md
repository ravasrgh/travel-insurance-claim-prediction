## Business Understanding

### Background

Between 2015 and 2017, Portugal's hospitality industry experienced significant growth, with over 21 million visitors in 2017 alone. However, this growth brought operational challenges, particularly with increasing cancellation rates driven by Online Travel Agencies (OTA) and flexible cancellation policies.

### Business Problem

Hotels face substantial challenges from unpredictable cancellations:

- **Financial Loss**: Empty rooms that cannot be resold lead to direct revenue loss, especially during high season
- **Operational Inefficiency**: Resources allocated based on reservations (staff, housekeeping, logistics) are wasted when cancellations occur
- **Planning Uncertainty**: Unpredictable cancellations hamper revenue forecasting and strategic marketing decisions

### Stakeholders

| No  | Stakeholder                     | Role                                                     |
| --- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Hotel Management                | Strategic decision-making                                |
| 2   | Reservation & Front Office Team | Manages bookings and guest interactions                  |
| 3   | Marketing & CRM Team            | Executes promotions and maintains customer relationships |
| 4   | Customers / Hotel Guests        | Service users                                            |
| 5   | Hotel Owners / Investors        | Capital owners and long-term decision makers             |

### Project Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Build a supervised learning model to classify whether a reservation will be cancelled or not, enabling management to:

- Take preventive actions (re-confirmation, promotions, upgrades)
- Adjust pricing and overbooking strategies
- Improve operational efficiency and revenue
- Reduce customer complaints and maintain hotel reputation
- Understand root causes of cancellations

**Specific Objectives**:

1. Identify customer behavior patterns leading to cancellations
2. Provide cancellation probability scores for each reservation
3. Support business decisions regarding overbooking, discounts, and proactive communication

### Business Impact Analysis

Using confusion matrix to understand business implications:

|                            | Predicted: Not Cancel (0) | Predicted: Cancel (1) |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Actual: Not Cancel (0)** | True Negative (TN)        | False Positive (FP)   |
| **Actual: Cancel (1)**     | False Negative (FN)       | True Positive (TP)    |

**False Negative (FN)** - Most costly: Model predicts no cancellation but booking is cancelled

- Hotel loses potential revenue as empty room cannot be resold
- Additional operational costs already incurred (staff, logistics)
- Cost: $500 per FN

**False Positive (FP)** - Less costly: Model predicts cancellation but booking proceeds

- May lead to overbooking issues
- However, revenue is still generated from the booking
- Cost: $100 per FP

**True Positive (TP)** - Value generation: Correctly predicts cancellation

- Hotel can take preventive measures
- Opportunity for persuasive strategies and promotions
- Revenue: $200 per TP

### Business Metrics

```
Cost Assumptions:
- FP Cost = $100
- FN Cost = $500
- TP Revenue = $200

Formula:
- total_cost = (fp × $100) + (fn × $500)
- total_revenue = tp × $200
- net_benefit = total_revenue - total_cost
- roi = (net_benefit / total_cost) × 100
```

### Machine Learning Strategy

Build a cancellation prediction model using Supervised Learning that:

- Predicts `is_canceled` based on historical customer and booking data
- Optimizes for **F2 Score** (beta=2) - emphasizes recall over precision
- Minimizes False Negatives (FN) which are more costly ($500) than False Positives ($100)

**Why F2 Score?**

The F2 Score weighs recall 2:1 over precision, making it ideal for scenarios where missing a cancellation (FN) is more costly than a false alarm (FP).

Formula:

```
F2 = (5 × Precision × Recall) / (4 × Precision + Recall)
```

**Expected Business Benefits**:

1. **Reduce Losses from Unexpected Cancellations**

   - More sensitive to potential cancellations
   - Enables preventive actions (discounts, confirmations)
   - Safer overbooking strategies

2. **Improve Operational Efficiency**

   - Avoid resource waste (staff, food, housekeeping)
   - Optimize staff scheduling and room preparation
   - Reduce fixed costs without revenue

3. **Maximize Model ROI**
   - Reducing FN decreases $500 losses per case
   - Increases net benefit and ROI

### Running Both Apps Simultaneously

You can run both applications at the same time on different ports:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Hotel Cancellation Predictor
cd models
source ../.venv_312/bin/activate
streamlit run hotel_cancellation_app.py

# Terminal 2 - Customer Reservation System
cd models
source ../.venv_312/bin/activate
streamlit run customer_reservation_app.py --server.port 8502
```

Access:

- Hotel Cancellation Predictor: http://localhost:8501
- Customer Reservation System: http://localhost:8502

---

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Error loading model - `_RemainderColsList` attribute error

**Solution**: Ensure Python 3.12 and scikit-learn 1.6.1 are being used

```bash
python --version  # Should show 3.12.x
python -c "import sklearn; print(sklearn.__version__)"  # Should show 1.6.1
```

**Issue**: Module `category_encoders` not found

**Solution**: Install the package

```bash
pip install category_encoders
```

**Issue**: XGBoost serialization warning

**Solution**: This is informational only and does not affect functionality. The model works correctly.

**Issue**: Streamlit port already in use

**Solution**: Use a different port

```bash
streamlit run hotel_cancellation_app.py --server.port 8503
```

## Model Performance

### Confusion Matrix Analysis

Based on test set (23,878 predictions):

```
Confusion Matrix:
                    Predicted: No Cancel  |  Predicted: Cancel
Actual: No Cancel              14,158     |       3,234
Actual: Cancel                    421     |       6,065
```

**Metrics Breakdown**:

- True Negatives (TN): 14,158 - Correctly predicted no cancellation
- False Positives (FP): 3,234 - Predicted cancel but didn't cancel
- False Negatives (FN): 421 - Predicted no cancel but cancelled (most costly)
- True Positives (TP): 6,065 - Correctly predicted cancellation

**Business Value**:

```
Costs:
- FP Cost: 3,234 × $100 = $323,400
- FN Cost: 421 × $500 = $210,500
- Total Cost: $533,900

Revenue:
- TP Revenue: 6,065 × $200 = $1,213,000

Net Benefit: $1,213,000 - $533,900 = $679,100
ROI: 127.2%
```

### Comparison with Baseline

**Baseline Strategy** (always predict majority class - no cancellation):

- Would miss all 6,486 cancellations
- Loss: 6,486 × $500 = $3,243,000

**Our Model**:

- Catches 6,065 out of 6,486 cancellations (93.5%)
- Reduces loss to $210,500 (93% reduction)
- **Savings**: $3,032,500 compared to baseline

### Model Advantages

1. **High Recall (92.92%)**: Catches vast majority of cancellations
2. **Strong ROI (65.62%)**: Positive business impact
3. **Excellent Discrimination (ROC-AUC: 0.9159)**: Clear separation between classes
4. **Actionable Predictions**: Provides probability scores for risk-based interventions
5. **Interpretable**: SHAP analysis explains individual predictions

### Model Limitations

1. **Lower Precision (54.74%)**: About 45% false alarms
2. **False Positives**: May lead to unnecessary interventions
3. **Data Dependency**: Performance based on 2015-2017 Portugal hotel data
4. **External Factors**: Cannot account for unforeseen events (pandemics, economic crises)
5. **Requires Updates**: Model should be retrained periodically with new data
